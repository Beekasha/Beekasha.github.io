 I decided to learn software development solely because it seems like a tangible skill that I would be good at learning. I’ve always been good at using software, but never really dabbled in creating it. 

With my past lines of work, I had to engage my brain minimally, and never really in a serious problem solving type of way. After doing some research on neuroplasticity, I realized I was fed up with not being challenged mentally on a daily basis, and was ready to make my brain operate differently, and in a way that could potentially impact the lives of others.

Talking with some engineers at my previous job made me realize that the job really is all about problem solving. And now that I’m enrolled in the Flatiron program, I have the motivation to learn quickly and find employment in a timely manner. I want to be able to build something meaningful, that people rely on each day to make their lives easier.
