	My first CLI project - a movie library - can be found at https://github.com/Beekasha/cli_movie_project/

	One of the things that helped me immensely during this first CLI project was writing pseudocode before committing to writing actual code. It’s paramount to have the mechanics of your program down before you start programming, to prevent further problems down the line. 

	Avi said something during one of his lecture videos that stuck with me, and that was “I’m always looking for new errors.” With programming, having the same error over and over could be very frustrating and leave you with no sense of what you should fix. Even if the error throws you back a few steps, at least there was progress in one direction or another. 

	I did think it was important to just throw us in the fire to create our own repository, because we’ll learn better by doing, instead of being stuck in a “tutorial purgatory” as many other coders suffer from. The thing I was most intimidated by coming into this project was the framework of each repository. But, as I can tell with even one repository created, this will get much easier with time. 

	I did not want my program to do all the scraping up front, because I enjoyed the idea of having functionality for any movie, not just a list of specific films. An error that gave me some trouble, was trying to utilize previously searched API results instead of making another API call. I solved this by having a Movie class method of “previously_searched?”. 

	I would still like to get some practice scraping websites with nokogiri. Using the API made the process a bit easier because I just symbolized the already existing keys of the returned movie hash.  But, knowing that I can make a blank screen turn into a working application gives a big boost of confidence for what’s to come.
